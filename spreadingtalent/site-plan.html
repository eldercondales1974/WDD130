       When someone lives among people that aren’t looking for success it seems that everything is going fine, when everything is normal and quiet with no problems, no challenges in life, it seems that everything is ok, but something new could knock on your door. The youth always think that everything is ok, that nothing will go out of the normal state, but suddenly something happens, and it forces you to go out of your comfort position, and just in that position you wonder: what am I going to do now? What can I do to sustain me when the person that did that is not here anymore, when that person is inability to keep supporting me and any other situations that could come up. What if I have a tool where I could meet others like me doing great things and being rewarded for what they passionately do? What if I encourage myself to try to know what my passion is, or if I discover that I was blessed with special skills to do something by myself. It could be painting, it could be math skills like solving math problems, or Rubik cube, or some sports, like basketball, football, ping pong, volleyball, swimming, or maybe other more mental skills, like chess. And If I see others young people like me doing great things and finding I place where I could show what I do and receiving positives feedback. That would be great. Others like you could motivate you to start or keep working in developing skills. For example, I like painting, arts are my passion, but I don’t know how to start and What do I need to start doing this? Oh, I remember that I watched an online site, or a friend showed me that site that caught my attention. What about if I access it? And there you find that there is a young woman showing that she does and even teaching how to do or how to start. Other example, a young man likes Rubik cube but thinks that is something not important because I’ve seen that dads give that to their children as a gift, but nothing happens. Visiting spreadtalent you notice that there is a young man like you that likes cubing like you as well, moreover, you discover that there is a technique to do it, and there are competitions around the globe, there is an association that groups everyone who likes cubing, even rewards for doing so. That’s great and wonderful. This is far beyond what I thought. You could interact with the person that does what you do also. Spread this information with your friends so you may know what wonderful things you could do and how many young people you could help by joining this idea. You have a brilliant future, you have much to discover and to do.

      <h3>Painting</h3>
      <p>
        Art is a profound and multifaceted expression of human creativity, imagination, and emotion. It encompasses a wide range of disciplines, including visual arts, performing arts, literary arts, and more. Visual arts, such as painting, sculpture, and photography, allow artists to convey their perceptions of the world through color, form, and composition. These works can evoke powerful emotions, provoke thought, and offer new perspectives on familiar subjects. The performing arts, including theater, dance, and music, bring stories and emotions to life through movement, sound, and performance. These forms of art create immersive experiences that can transport audiences to different times, places, and states of mind. Literary arts, such as poetry, fiction, and drama, use language as a medium to explore the human condition, express ideas, and tell stories. Writers craft narratives that can inspire, challenge, and entertain, often reflecting the complexities of life and society. The written word has the power to connect people across cultures and generations, offering insights into diverse experiences and viewpoints. Art is not only a means of personal expression but also a reflection of cultural identity and societal values. Throughout history, art has played a crucial role in documenting and shaping human experiences. From ancient cave paintings to contemporary digital art, each era has produced unique artistic styles and movements that mirror the social, political, and technological changes of the time. For example, the Renaissance period saw a resurgence of classical ideals and techniques, while modern art movements like Cubism and Surrealism challenged traditional notions of representation and reality. The impact of art extends beyond individual and cultural expression; it also has significant economic and educational value. The art industry includes galleries, museums, theaters, and festivals, which contribute to local and global economies. Art education fosters creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills, making it an essential component of holistic development. Schools and communities that prioritize art education often see benefits in student engagement, academic performance, and social cohesion. Art also serves as a powerful tool for social change and activism. Artists often use their work to address pressing issues such as inequality, environmental sustainability, and human rights. Through visual symbolism, poignant performances, and compelling narratives, art can raise awareness, inspire action, and foster empathy. Movements like Dadaism and street art have historically challenged the status quo, pushing boundaries and encouraging societal reflection and transformation. In the digital age, art continues to evolve, embracing new technologies and platforms. Digital art, virtual reality, and interactive installations offer innovative ways for artists to create and audiences to experience art. Social media and online galleries have democratized access to art, allowing creators to reach global audiences and engage with diverse communities. This technological integration has expanded the possibilities for artistic expression and collaboration, making art more accessible and inclusive.Ultimately, art is a testament to the boundless potential of human creativity. It enriches our lives, connects us to our shared humanity, and provides a means to explore and understand the world around us. Whether through a breathtaking painting, a moving performance, or a thought-provoking poem, art has the power to inspire, challenge, and transform. It is a vital and enduring aspect of human culture, continually evolving and adapting to reflect the ever-changing landscape of human experience.

      <h3>Rubik</h3>
      <p>
        The Rubik's Cube, invented in 1974 by Hungarian architect Ernő Rubik, is a 3D combination puzzle that has captivated millions around the world. Originally called the "Magic Cube," it was renamed after its creator and became a global sensation in the 1980s. The standard Rubik's Cube consists of 26 smaller cubes, known as cubies, which form a larger cube with six faces, each face covered by nine stickers in six solid colors: white, red, blue, orange, green, and yellow. The objective is to twist and turn the cube to return it to its original state, where each face is a single, solid color. Solving the Rubik's Cube requires a blend of spatial awareness, problem-solving skills, and memory. There are various methods to solve the cube, ranging from beginner techniques to advanced algorithms. The most common beginner method is the layer-by-layer approach, where one solves the cube layer by layer, starting with the first face and working down to the last. Advanced solvers often use algorithms such as CFOP (Cross, F2L, OLL, PLL), which significantly reduce the number of moves needed to solve the cube. The Rubik's Cube has also become a competitive sport, with speedcubing competitions held worldwide. Speedcubers, as they are known, aim to solve the cube in the shortest time possible. The current world record for solving the standard 3x3 Rubik's Cube is under 4 seconds, showcasing the incredible dexterity and mental agility of top competitors. These events often include various categories, such as solving the cube blindfolded, with one hand, or even with feet. Beyond its role as a puzzle and competitive sport, the Rubik's Cube has influenced various fields, including mathematics, computer science, and art. Mathematicians study the cube to understand permutation groups and algorithms, while computer scientists have developed programs to solve the cube using artificial intelligence. Artists have used the cube's colorful patterns to create mosaic artworks, and it has even appeared in popular culture, symbolizing intellectual challenge and creativity. The Rubik's Cube's enduring popularity can be attributed to its simplicity and complexity. It is easy to understand but challenging to master, making it accessible to people of all ages. Its design has remained largely unchanged over the decades, yet it continues to inspire new generations of solvers and enthusiasts. Whether as a casual pastime, a competitive pursuit, or a subject of academic study, the Rubik's Cube remains a fascinating and iconic puzzle that has stood the test of time.
