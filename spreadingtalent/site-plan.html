        When someone lives among people that aren’t looking for success it seems that everything is going fine, when everything is normal and quiet with no problems, no challenges in life, it seems that everything is ok, but something new could knock on your door. The youth always think that everything is ok, that nothing will go out of the normal state, but suddenly something happens, and it forces you to go out of your comfort position, and just in that position you wonder: what am I going to do now? What can I do to sustain me when the person that did that is not here anymore, when that person is inability to keep supporting me and any other situations that could come up. What if I have a tool where I could meet others like me doing great things and being rewarded for what they passionately do? What if I encourage myself to try to know what my passion is, or if I discover that I was blessed with special skills to do something by myself. It could be painting, it could be math skills like solving math problems, or Rubik cube, or some sports, like basketball, football, ping pong, volleyball, swimming, or maybe other more mental skills, like chess. And If I see others young people like me doing great things and finding I place where I could show what I do and receiving positives feedback. That would be great. Others like you could motivate you to start or keep working in developing skills. For example, I like painting, arts are my passion, but I don’t know how to start and What do I need to start doing this? Oh, I remember that I watched an online site, or a friend showed me that site that caught my attention. What about if I access it? And there you find that there is a young woman showing that she does and even teaching how to do or how to start. Other example, a young man likes Rubik cube but thinks that is something not important because I’ve seen that dads give that to their children as a gift, but nothing happens. Visiting spreadtalent you notice that there is a young man like you that likes cubing like you as well, moreover, you discover that there is a technique to do it, and there are competitions around the globe, there is an association that groups everyone who likes cubing, even rewards for doing so. That’s great and wonderful. This is far beyond what I thought. You could interact with the person that does what you do also. Spread this information with your friends so you may know what wonderful things you could do and how many young people you could help by joining this idea. You have a brilliant future, you have much to discover and to do.
